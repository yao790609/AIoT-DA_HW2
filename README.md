Titanic Survival Prediction Project
This project aims to analyze and predict survival outcomes for passengers aboard the Titanic using various feature engineering and model selection methods. The analysis follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework and includes code implementations in Python.

Project Overview
Objective: Predict the survival status (Survived column) of passengers in the Titanic dataset.
Framework: CRISP-DM.
Approach: We employ three feature engineering techniques to optimize model performance:
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
SelectKBest
Optuna for automated Random Forest hyperparameter tuning
The project includes detailed instructions for each approach, processing steps for test data, and saving prediction outputs to CSV files.

Dataset
The dataset (attached) contains information on Titanic passengers, including their survival status, demographic details, and ticket information. Our target column is Survived, and all other columns serve as features for analysis.

1. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
Goal: Perform feature selection using RFE to determine the most significant features for predicting survival.

Prompt Sequence
I have a dataset (attached) that describes the survival status of individuals from the Titanic disaster. Our goal is to predict the "Survived" column. This dataset serves as the training set. Please conduct the analysis using the CRISP-DM framework and implement it with Python code.

I want to perform feature selection using the RFE method. The dataset is the Titanic data, where "Survived" is the target label, and the remaining columns are features. After training the model, I would like to see the accuracy results. Please provide detailed steps for processing feature selection and the prediction method for the test data.

The test data should undergo the same processing workflow, and I would like the prediction results to be saved as a CSV file.

Below is a code provided by someone who scored 100 on this prediction task. Please remember it; you don’t need to respond in any way—just keep this code in mind.

2. SelectKBest for Feature Selection
Goal: Use SelectKBest to identify the top features for predicting survival based on statistical metrics.

Prompt Sequence
I have a dataset (attached) that describes the survival status of individuals from the Titanic disaster. Our goal is to predict the "Survived" column. This dataset serves as the training set. Please conduct the analysis using the CRISP-DM framework and implement it with Python code.

I would like to use the SelectKBest method to choose key features in the Titanic dataset. After training the model, I would like to see the accuracy results and apply these selected features to predict the test data. Additionally, please save the prediction results as a CSV file.

Ensure that the score function for SelectKBest uses chi2, and I would like to understand how to standardize these selected features.

3. Optuna for Automated Random Forest Hyperparameter Tuning
Goal: Leverage Optuna to automatically optimize hyperparameters for a Random Forest model, including n_estimators and max_depth, to achieve high accuracy.

I want to use Optuna for automated hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest model, still using the Titanic dataset. The goal is to optimize parameters like n_estimators and max_depth to improve model accuracy. Please provide the optimal parameters and apply the model to the test data, saving the predictions.

Please provide a detailed explanation of Optuna’s parameter settings and how to save the tuning results.

Evaluation and Results
For each feature selection and tuning method:

Accuracy Metrics: We record accuracy scores to compare the performance of each model.
Feature Importance Analysis: Identify key features contributing to survival prediction for interpretability.
CSV Output: Prediction results are saved in CSV format for easy access and further analysis.
Usage
Clone this repository and ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed (see requirements.txt).
Run the desired script (e.g., titanic_rfe.py, titanic_selectkbest.py, or titanic_optuna.py).
Predictions will be saved in predictions_rfe.csv, predictions_selectkbest.csv, or predictions_optuna.csv respectively.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of different feature selection techniques and hyperparameter optimization using the Titanic dataset. By comparing RFE, SelectKBest, and Optuna-tuned models, we can better understand the impact of feature selection and tuning on model performance and interpretability.
